# What does this docker contain?

Basically it contain completely local SingularityNet environment. It can be
used to run SingularityNet services locally without using external Ethereum
networks.

What is done in the docker image:

* local IPFS instance is deployed and started 
* Ganache instance is started with predefined network number and mnemonic to
  generate predictable accounts numbers and private keys 
* local network id is exported as `$NETWORK_ID` environment variable;
* all contracts are already deployed and their addresses are written to
  `snet-cli` configuration and exported as environment variables:
  `$TOKEN_ADDR`, `$REGISTRY_ADDR`, `$MULTIPARTYESCROW_ADDR`;
* local Ethereum node and IPFS instance are added into snet-cli configuration
* all addresses and private keys generated by Ganache are exported as
  environment variables: `$DEPLOYER_ADDR`, `$DEPLOYER_KEY`, `$CALLER_ADDR`,
  `$CALLER_KEY`, `$PUBLISHER_ADDR`, `$PUBLISHER_KEY`;
* couple of `snet-cli` identities are created: `deployer` and `caller`, which
  are first and second identities generated by ganache-cli on start
  respectively.
* local ETCD instance is deployed and started to allow you starting daemon
  without ETCD.
* IPFS, Ethereum and service ports are exported from docker container. Thus
  IPFS endpoint is `http://localhost:5002`, Ethereum endpoint is
  `http://localhost:8545` and daemon endpoint is `http://localhost:7000`.
* Service endpoint is `http://localhost:7003`, its port is not exported. Thus
  service available only via daemon.
* All services use HTTP to simplify setup.
* [Example Service](https://github.com/singnet/example-service) is deployed
  under `example-org` with `example-service` id.

# Usage

Build docker:
```
./docker_build.sh
```

Run docker:
```
./docker_run.sh
```

To try example service execute:
```
snet identity caller
snet client call example-org example-service default_group mul '{ "a": 6, "b": 7 }' -y
```

To publish own service use ["How to Publish a SingularityNET
Service"](https://dev.singularitynet.io/tutorials/publish/) tutorial as a guide.
